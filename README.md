# 🧠 Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts employee salaries based on various factors such as age, gender, education level, job title, and years of experience using a Linear Regression model. It demonstrates how machine learning can help HR departments estimate fair compensation based on historical data.

## 📁 Files Included

- employee_salary_prediction.ipynb – Main Colab/Jupyter Notebook with full code
- Salaryprediction.csv – Dataset used for model training
- output_plot.png – Scatter plot of actual vs predicted salaries (optional)
- requirements.txt – List of Python packages (optional)

## 📊 Features Used

- Age
- Gender
- Education Level
- Job Title
- Years of Experience

## 🧪 Machine Learning Algorithm

- *Linear Regression*
- Preprocessing with OneHotEncoder and ColumnTransformer
- Model pipeline using sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline

## 🧠 Model Workflow

1. Data Loading and Cleaning
2. Feature Selection and Encoding
3. Train/Test Split
4. Model Training using Linear Regression
5. Evaluation using R² Score and Mean Squared Error
6. Result Visualization (scatter plot)

## 📈 Model Evaluation

- *R² Score:* Add your score here
- *Mean Squared Error:* Add your MSE value here

## 📷 Sample Output

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Use advanced models like Random Forest or XGBoost
- Add more features: company, location, job level
- Deploy the model as a Streamlit web app
- Automate data updates for real-time prediction
